# friends-js
Friends.js: a sample React app for keeping track of your friends.

The intention of this project is for me to be able to build something less trivial than "hello world" in React.

The use idea is an app to keep track of your friends, or people you think are your friends, and help you log whether interactions with them make you happier or not.
